# html
I am starting my new streak of 30days on HTML. Feel free to comment on any point.
I will be Updating each and every minute code snippet.
Trying to automate as much as i can using shell scripting.
All the lazy fellas, checkout my script file(gitcommit.sh) for adding and commiting each change in just one command.
Just run the script by './gitcommit.sh' and BOOM your changes are commited. 
Will be refining the script evryday if i can, to reduce logic bugs.
