## What's NEW ?

### Trying to automate as much as i can, using shell scripting.
All the lazy fellas, checkout my script file(gitcommit.sh) for adding and commiting each change in just one command.

Just run the script by 
```bash
./gitcommit.sh
```
BOOM your changes are commited. 

Will be refining the script evryday if i can, to reduce logic bugs.
